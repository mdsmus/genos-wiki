Features
--------

* Rameau has implemented nine algorithms for harmonic analysis
* Rameau has an easy format for creating answer sheets
* Rameau provides an easy way to compare different algorithms
* Rameau performs chord labeling and roman numeral functional
analysis.

Download
--------

Right now Rameau is only available from the
http://git.genos.mus.br/?r=rameau[git repository]. A binary
distribution is planned real soon. To download the source code,
install git and issue the following command:
